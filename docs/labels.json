Primarily concerned with representing the Danish landscape, and particularly fond of the peaceful countryside of Zealand and mid-Jutland, Kyhn painted many romanticized views of his native land. He traveled to Italy in 1850, but his paintings of foreign sites are relatively rare. He taught at both the School of Drawing and the School of Painting at the Academy in Copenhagen and opened the School for Drawing and Applied Art for Women at a time when women were not allowed access to the Academy."}],"depictions":[{"license":"cc:by-sa\/3.0\/","thumbnail":"https:\/\/fitz-cms-images.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com\/cat.-108-ag-khyn2-2.jpg","@id":"https:\/\/fitz-cms-images.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com\/cat.-108-ag-khyn2-2.jpg"}],"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["14.2280874470536","40.54877475"],"certainty":"certain"}},{"type":"Feature","@id":"http:\/\/localhost:8000\/visit-us\/exhibitions\/true-to-nature-open-air-painting-in-europe-1780-1870\/labels\/the-thames-at-chelsea-evening","properties":{"title":"The Thames at Chelsea, Evening - William Holman Hunt","artist":"William Holman Hunt","slug":"the-thames-at-chelsea-evening","birth":"London","death":"London","theme":"Skies and Effects","institution":"Fitzwilliam Museum"},"descriptions":[{"value":"Hunt started his career as an office clerk, taking evening drawing classes and eventually gaining admittance to the Royal Academy Schools in 1844.
